<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.

Iâ€™m a research associate at [Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC)](https://www.tacc.utexas.ed) 
where I study performance of scientific computing software and High-Performance Computing (HPC) platforms.
In the meantime, I have been long-serving as secretary of High Performance Group (HPG) 
at the [Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC)](https://www.spec.org/hpg/).  

Previously, I was a principal system analyst at 
[Indiana University System](https://pti.iu.edu/centers/rt/index.html). 
I collaborated with many scientists from Indiana University Bloomington
and Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis to accelerate science with HPC. 

Before switching to technology, my life was dedicated to scientific research. 
I obtained PhD in chemical physics from [Indiana University Bloomington](https://www.indiana.edu)
with a focus on theoretical & computational chemistry. 
I developed and implemented multiple new quantum chemistry methods 
in the Gaussian quantum chemistry software package. 
I was a key developer for Link-121 (Atom-centered Density Matrix Propagation), 
fragment-based ab initio molecular dynamics, and quantum nuclear wavepacket ab initio molecular dynamics.
