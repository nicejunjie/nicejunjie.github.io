The increased complexity poses challenges for performance portability and performance evaluation. The Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC) has a long history of producing industry-standard benchmarks for modern computer systems. SPEC’s newly released SPEChpc 2021 benchmark suites, developed by the High Performance Group, are a bold attempt to provide a fair and objective benchmarking tool designed for state-of-the-art HPC systems. With the support of multiple host and accelerator programming models, the suites are portable across both homogeneous and heterogeneous architectures. Different workloads are developed to fit system sizes ranging from a few compute nodes to a few hundred compute nodes. In this work we present our first experiences in performance benchmarking the new SPEChpc2021 suites and evaluate their portability and basic performance characteristics on various popular and emerging HPC architectures, including x86 CPU, NVIDIA GPU, and AMD GPU. This study provides a first-hand experience of executing the SPEChpc 2021 suites at scale on production HPC systems, discusses real-world use cases, and serves as an initial guideline for using the benchmark suites. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">NeuroImage</abbr></div> <div id="neuroimage-qiuting2" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Tau-related white-matter alterations along spatially selective pathways</div> <div class="author"> Qiuting Wen, Shannon L Risacher, Linhui Xie,  <em>Junjie Li</em>, Jaroslaw Harezlak, Martin R Farlow, Frederick W Unverzagt, Sujuan Gao, Liana G Apostolova, Andrew J Saykin,  and Yu-Chien Wu </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Neuroimage,</em> Feb 2021 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/with_qiuting/neuroimage-qiuting2.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> Progressive accumulation of tau neurofibrillary tangles in the brain is a defining pathologic feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Tau pathology exhibits a predictable spatiotemporal spreading pattern, but the underlying mechanisms of this spread are poorly understood. Although AD is conventionally considered a disease of the gray matter, it is also associated with pronounced and progressive deterioration of the white matter (WM). A link between abnormal tau and WM degeneration is suggested by findings from both animal and postmortem studies, but few studies demonstrated their interplay in vivo. Recent advances in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and the availability of tau positron emission tomography (PET) have made it possible to evaluate the association of tau and WM degeneration (tau-WM) in vivo. In this study, we explored the spatial pattern of tau-WM associations across the whole brain to evaluate the hypothesis that tau deposition is associated with WM microstructural alterations not only in isolated tracts, but in continuous structural connections in a stereotypic pattern. Sixty-two participants, including 22 cognitively normal subjects, 22 individuals with subjective cognitive decline, and 18 with mild cognitive impairment were included in the study. WM characteristics were inferred by classic diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and a complementary diffusion compartment model – neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) that provides a proxy for axonal density. A data-driven iterative searching (DDIS) approach, coupled with whole-brain graph theory analyses, was developed to continuously track tau-WM association patterns. Without applying prior knowledge of the tau spread, we observed a distinct spatial pattern that resembled the typical propagation of tau pathology in AD. Such association pattern was not observed between diffusion and amyloid-β PET signal. Tau-related WM degeneration is characterized by an increase in the mean diffusivity (with a dominant change in the radial direction) and a decrease in the intra-axonal volume fraction. These findings suggest that cortical tau deposition (as measured in tau PET) is associated with a lower axonal packing density and greater diffusion freedom. In conclusion, our in vivo findings using a data-driven method on cross-sectional data underline the important role of WM alterations in the AD pathological cascade with an association pattern similar to the postmortem Braak staging of AD. Future studies will focus on longitudinal analyses to provide in vivo evidence of tau pathology spreads along neuroanatomically connected brain areas. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="year">2020</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">SuperCompCloud</abbr></div> <div id="sc20-cloud-gpu" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Performance Characteristics of Virtualized GPUs for Deep Learning</div> <div class="author"> Scott Michael, Scott Teige,  <em>Junjie Li</em>, John Michael Lowe, George Turner,  and Robert Henschel </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In 2020 IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Interoperability of Supercomputing and Cloud Technologies (SuperCompCloud),</em> Nov 2020 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/uits/sc20-cloud-gpu.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>As deep learning techniques and algorithms become more and more common in scientific workflows, HPC centers are grappling with how best to provide GPU resources and support deep learning workloads. One novel method of deployment is to virtualize GPU resources allowing for multiple VM instances to have logically distinct virtual GPUs (vGPUs) on a shared physical GPU. However, there are many operational and performance implications to consider before deploying a vGPU service in an HPC center. In this paper, we investigate the performance characteristics of vGPUs for both traditional HPC workloads and for deep learning training and inference workloads. Using NVIDIA’s vDWS virtualization software, we perform a series of HPC and deep learning benchmarks on both non-virtualized (bare metal) and vGPUs of various sizes and configurations. We report on several of the challenges we discovered in deploying and operating a variety of virtualized instance sizes and configurations. We find that the overhead of virtualization on HPC workloads is generally &lt; 10%, and can vary considerably for deep learning, depending on the task. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Angew.Chem.</abbr></div> <div id="angewandte-yubing3" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">An Organic–Inorganic Hybrid Cathode Based on S–Se Dynamic Covalent Bonds</div> <div class="author"> Jiawei Zhao, Yubing Si, Zixiao Han,  <em>Junjie Li</em>, Wei Guo,  and Yongzhu Fu </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Angewandte Chemie International Edition,</em> Feb 2020 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/with_yubing/angewandte-yubing3.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>A diphenyl trisulfide–selenium nanowire (DPTS-Se) organic–inorganic hybrid cathode material is presented for rechargeable lithium batteries.

Organodisulfides provide precise lithiation sites, and therefore are valuable models for the study of redox reactions in lithium batteries. To understand their electrochemical behavior, we investigate three disulfides with different N-containing heterocycles including 2,2′-dipyridyl disulfide (2,2′-DpyDS), 4,4′-dipyridyl disulfide (4,4′-DpyDS), and 2,2′-dipyridyl disulfide-N,N′-dioxide (DpyDSDO). The three disulfides all show higher discharge voltage plateaus due to the electron-withdrawing groups: DPDS (2.20 V) &lt; 2,2′-DpyDS (2.45 V) = 4,4′-DpyDS (2.45 V) &lt; DpyDSDO (2.80 V). In particular, 2,2′-DpyDS exhibits an outstanding 69% capacity retention over 500 cycles. Our theoretical simulations show that lithium pyridine-2-thiolate, the discharge product of 2,2′-DpyDS, forms compact clusters via N⋯Li⋯S bridges coordinated by lithium ions, which can help reduce its dissolution in liquid electrolyte, and therefore increase the cycle life. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry is demonstrated to be a powerful tool for the investigation of discharge/recharge products of soluble organodisulfides in rechargeable lithium batteries.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2018</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Electrochim.Acta</abbr></div> <div id="electrochimica-yubing" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Fabrication of B doped g-C3N4/TiO2 heterojunction for efficient photoelectrochemical water oxidation</div> <div class="author"> Weiqian Kong, Xiaofan Zhang, Binbin Chang, Yannan Zhou, Shouren Zhang, Guangli He, Baocheng Yang,  and <em>Junjie Li</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Electrochimica Acta,</em> Aug 2018 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/with_yubing/electacta-yubing1.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p></p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="year">2017</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">JCTC</abbr></div> <div id="jctc-fragaimd3" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Efficient, “On-the-Fly”, Born–Oppenheimer and Car–Parrinello-type Dynamics with Coupled Cluster Accuracy through Fragment Based Electronic Structure</div> <div class="author"> Cody Haycraft,  <em>Junjie Li</em>,  and Srinivasan S.

The dynamics trajectories are obtained using both Born–Oppenheimer and extended Lagrangian (Car–Parrinello-style) options, and hence, here, for the first time, we present Car–Parrinello-like AIMD trajectories that are accurate to the CCSD level of post-Hartree–Fock theory. The specific extended Lagrangian implementation used here is a generalization to atom-centered density matrix propagation (ADMP) that provides post-Hartree–Fock accuracy, and hence the new method is abbreviated as ADMP-pHF; whereas the Born–Oppenheimer version is called frag-BOMD. The fragmentation methodology is based on a set-theoretic, inclusion-exclusion principle based generalization of the well-known ONIOM method. Thus, the fragmentation scheme contains multiple overlapping “model” systems, and overcounting is compensated through the inclusion-exclusion principle. The energy functional thus obtained is used to construct Born–Oppenheimer forces (frag-BOMD) and is also embedded within an extended Lagrangian (ADMP-pHF). The dynamics is tested by computing structural and vibrational properties for protonated water clusters. The frag-BOMD trajectories yield structural and vibrational properties in excellent agreement with full CCSD-based “on-the-fly” BOMD trajectories, at a small fraction of the cost. The asymptotic (large system) computational scaling of both frag-BOMD and ADMP-pHF is inferred as , for on-the-fly CCSD accuracy. The extended Lagrangian implementation, ADMP-pHF, also provides structural features in excellent agreement with full “on-the-fly” CCSD calculations, but the dynamical frequencies are slightly red-shifted. Furthermore, we study the behavior of ADMP-pHF as a function of the electronic inertia tensor and find a monotonic improvement in the red-shift as we reduce the electronic inertia. In all cases a uniform spectral scaling factor, that in our preliminary studies appears to be independent of system and independent of level of theory (same scaling factor for both MP2 and CCSD implementations ADMP-pHF and for ADMP DFT), improves on agreement between ADMP-pHF and full CCSD calculations. Hence, we believe both frag-BOMD and ADMP-pHF will find significant utility in modeling complex systems. The computational power of frag-BOMD and ADMP-pHF is demonstrated through preliminary studies on a much larger protonated 21-water cluster, for which AIMD trajectories with “on-the-fly” CCSD are not feasible.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="year">2016</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">JCTC</abbr></div> <div id="jctc-fragaimd2" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Hybrid extended Lagrangian, post-Hartree–Fock Born–Oppenheimer ab initio molecular dynamics using fragment-based electronic structure</div> <div class="author"> <em>Junjie Li</em>, Cody Haycraft,  and Srinivasan S.

The specific fragmentation algorithm used here is derived from ONIOM but includes multiple, overlapping “model” systems. The interaction between the various overlapping model systems is approximated by invoking the principle of inclusion–exclusion at the chosen higher level of theory and within a “real” calculation performed at the chosen lower level of theory. Furthermore, here, the lower level electronic structure of the full system is propagated through an extended Lagrangian formalism, whereas the fragments, treated using post-Hartree–Fock electronic structure theories, are computed using the normal converged Born–Oppenheimer treatment. This conservative dynamical approach largely reduces the computational cost to approximate on-the-fly dynamics using post-Hartree–Fock electronic structure techniques and can be very beneficial for large systems where SCF convergence may be challenging and time consuming. Benchmarks are provided for medium-sized protonated water clusters, H9O4+ and H13O6+, and polypeptide fragments, including a proline tripeptide fragment, and alanine decamer. Structural features are in excellent agreement between the hybrid approach using an MP2:B3LYP fragment-based electronic structure and BOMD using MP2 for the full system. Vibrational properties derived from dynamical correlation functions do show a small redshift for the extended Lagrangian treatments, especially at higher frequencies. Strategies are discussed to improve this redshift. The computational methodology works in parallel using both MPI and OpenMP and shows good scaling with the processor number. The timing benchmarks are provided for the alanine decamer. A powerful feature of the computational implementation is the fact that it is completely decoupled from the electronic structure package being employed and thus allows for an integrated approach that may include several different packages. These computational aspects will be further probed in future publications.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">PCCP</abbr></div> <div id="pccp-carbocation" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A Grotthuss-like proton shuttle in the anomalous C2H3+ carbocation: energetic and vibrational properties for isotopologues</div> <div class="author"> <em>Junjie Li</em>, Alexander B.

Our computational study includes electronic structure treatment, incorporation of nuclear motion through classical and quantum paradigms, the effect of temperature, and the associated sampling of the potential surface, and the effect of single H/D isotopic substitution (i.e., C2H2D+). We find that while the non-classical, “Bridged” isomer is most stable, the “Classical” form does have a small presence under ambient conditions since the zero point level straddles the barrier between the Classical and Bridged isomers in a reduced dimensional analysis of the Bridged ↔ Classical transfer coordinate. But the probability of the classical structure is too low and hence may remain undetected from the vibrational properties of the system. For the deuterated counterpart, the deuterium preferentially occupies the terminal instead of bridge position, in the more stable bridged isomeric structure. This preference is noted from nuclear dynamics. In all cases, at higher temperatures, an orbiting phenomenon is observed where the hydrogen atom density is distributed as an oblate ellipsoid surrounding the carbon–carbon bond. This is not observed at lower temperatures and the orbiting phenomenon is probed here by computing two-dimensional, time–frequency vibrational spectra, which show the spectral evolution in time and temperature, and the development of the system from one kind of isomer to another. New experiments that may probe this isomeric multiplicity are suggested, and these involve a combination of infra-red multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) and argon-tagged action spectroscopy.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2015</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">JCTC</abbr></div> <div id="jctc-fragaimd1" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics Using Recursive, Spatially Separated, Overlapping Model Subsystems Mixed within an ONIOM-Based Fragmentation Energy Extrapolation Technique</div> <div class="author"> <em>Junjie Li</em>,  and Srinivasan S.

For potential energy surface benchmarks, we sample the normal coordinates and compare our surface energies with full MP2 and CCSD(T) calculations. The mean absolute error for the fragment-based algorithm is &lt;0.05 kcal/mol, when compared with MP2 calculations, and &lt;0.07 kcal/mol, when compared with CCSD(T) calculations over 693 different geometries for the H9O4+ system. For the larger H(H2O)21+ water cluster, the mean absolute error is on the order of a 0.1 kcal/mol, when compared with full MP2 calculations for 84 different geometries, at a fraction of the computational cost. Ab initio dynamics calculations were performed for H9O4+ and H13O6+, and the energy conservation was found to be of the order of 0.01 kcal/mol for short trajectories (on the order of a picosecond). The trajectories were kept short because our algorithm does not currently include dynamical fragmentation, which will be considered in future publications. Nevertheless, the velocity autocorrelation functions and their Fourier transforms computed from the fragment-based AIMD approaches were found to be in excellent agreement with those computed using the respective higher level of theory from the chosen hybrid calculation.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">J.Phys.Chem.B</abbr></div> <div id="jpcb-slo1" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Active Site Dynamical Effects in the Hydrogen Transfer Rate-limiting Step in the Catalysis of Linoleic Acid by Soybean Lipoxygenase-1 (SLO-1): Primary and Secondary Isotope Contributions</div> <div class="author"> Prasad Phatak, Jordan Venderley, John Debrota,  <em>Junjie Li</em>,  and Srinivasan S.

The role of two different active site components is probed. (a) On the hydrogen atom acceptor side of the active site, the hydrogen bonding propensity between the acceptor side hydroxyl group, which is bound to the iron cofactor, and the backbone carboxyl group of isoleucine (residue number 839) is studied toward its role in promoting the hydrogen transfer event. Primary and secondary (H/D) isotope effects are also probed and a definite correlation with subtle secondary H/D isotope effects is found. With increasing average nuclear kinetic energy, the increase in transfer probability is enhanced due to the presence of the hydrogen bond between the backbone carbonyl of I839 and the acceptor oxygen. Further increase in average nuclear kinetic energy reduces the strength of this secondary hydrogen bond which leads to a deterioration in hydrogen transfer rates and finally embrances an Arrhenius-like behavior. (b) On the hydrogen atom donor side, the coupling between vibrational modes predominantly localized on the donor-side linoleic acid group and the reactive mode is probed. There appears to be a qualitative difference in the coupling between modes that belong to linoleic acid and the hydrogen transfer mode, for hydrogen and deuterium transfer. For example, the donor side secondary hydrogen atom is much more labile (by nearly a factor of 5) during deuterium transfer as compared to the case for hydrogen transfer. This appears to indicate a greater coupling between the modes belonging to the linoleic acid scaffold and the deuterium transfer mode and also provides a new rationalization for the abnormal (nonclassical) secondary isotope effect results obtained by Knapp, Rickert, and Klinman in J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2002, 124, 3865. To substantiate our findings noted in point a above, we have suggested an I839 → A839 or I839 → V839 mutation. This will modify the bulkiness of hydrogen the bonding residue, allowing greater flexibility in the secondary hydrogen bond formation highlighted above and adversely affecting the reaction rate.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">JCTC</abbr></div> <div id="jctc-mcqwaimd" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Vibrational Properties of Hydrogen-Bonded Systems Using the Multireference Generalization to the “On-the-Fly” Electronic Structure within Quantum Wavepacket ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (QWAIMD)</div> <div class="author"> <em>Junjie Li</em>, Xiaohu Li,  and Srinivasan S.

Here, multiple single-particle electronic density matrices are simultaneously propagated with a quantum nuclear wavepacket and other classical nuclear degrees of freedom. The multiple density matrices are coupled through a nonorthogonal configuration interaction (NOCI) procedure to construct the instantaneous potential surface. An adaptive-mesh-guided set of basis functions composed of Gaussian primitives are used to simplify the electronic structure calculations. Specifically, with the replacement of the atom-centered basis functions positioned on the centers of the quantum-mechanically treated nuclei by a mesh-guided band of basis functions, the two-electron integrals used to compute the electronic structure potential surface become independent of the quantum nuclear variable and hence reusable along the entire Cartesian grid representing the quantum nuclear coordinates. This reduces the computational complexity involved in obtaining a potential surface and facilitates the interpretation of the individual density matrices as representative diabatic states. The parametric nuclear position dependence of the diabatic states is evaluated at the initial time-step using a Shannon-entropy-based sampling function that depends on an approximation to the quantum nuclear wavepacket and the potential surface. This development is meant as a precursor to an on-the-fly fully multireference electronic structure procedure embedded, on-the-fly, within a quantum nuclear dynamics formalism. We benchmark the current development by computing structural, dynamic, and spectroscopic features for a series of bihalide hydrogen-bonded systems: FHF–, ClHCl–, BrHBr–, and BrHCl–. We find that the donor–acceptor structural features are in good agreement with experiments. Spectroscopic features are computed using a unified velocity/flux autocorrelation function and include vibrational fundamentals and combination bands. These agree well with experiments and other theories.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2014</h2> <ol class="bibliography"></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Junjie Li.
